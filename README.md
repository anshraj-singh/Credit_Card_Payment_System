        {
          "id": "customer123",
          "name": "John Doe",
          "email": "johndoe@example.com"
        },
        {
          "id": "customer124",
          "name": "Jane Smith",
          "email": "janesmith@example.com"
        }
      ]
      ```
    - **404 Not Found:**
      ```json
      {
        "message": "No customers found."
      }
      ```

#### **Security Configuration**

- `/Users/me`, `/customers/**`, `/transactions/**` → Accessible to authenticated users.

### How to Test
1. **Start the Server:**
  - Ensure the application is running on the appropriate port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
2. **Admin Authentication:**
  - Use **Basic Auth** in Postman (admin credentials are required).
3. **Endpoint Testing:**
  - Test `/admin/all-customers` for fetching all customers.
  - Confirm restricted access for non-admin users.

## Transaction Processing Update
TransactionService:

- Implemented functionality to deduct the transaction amount from the credit card balance during transaction processing.
- Added checks for sufficient balance before completing a transaction.


TransactionController:

- Enhanced error handling to provide meaningful feedback for insufficient funds or when a credit card is not found.
- Updated response messages to improve user experience.


## Email Notifications Feature Update

### Introduction

The recent update to the Email Notifications feature enhances communication with customers regarding their transactions. Customers will now receive immediate email notifications after a transaction is processed, ensuring they are informed about their financial activities.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Email Notifications**: Customers receive an email notification immediately after a transaction is processed.
- **Email Content**: The email includes:
    - The amount of the transaction.
    - A confirmation that the transaction has been processed.
    - A subject line indicating it is a transaction notification.

### Implementation Details

1. **Transaction Entity**:
    - The `Transaction` entity has been updated to remove the `customerEmail` field. The email is now derived from the associated `Customer` entity.

2. **Email Service**:
    - The `EmailService` class is responsible for sending email notifications using `JavaMailSender`.

3. **Transaction Service Logic**:
    - When a transaction is saved, the system checks the associated credit card for sufficient balance.
    - Upon successful transaction processing, the system retrieves the customer's email from the `Customer` entity linked to the credit card.
    - An email notification is sent to the customer using the `EmailService`.

### Error Handling

- **Insufficient Balance**: If the credit card does not have enough balance, an exception is thrown, and no email is sent.
- **Customer Not Found**: If the customer associated with the credit card cannot be found, an appropriate error message is logged.

### Testing the Feature

1. **Create a Transaction**: Test the feature by creating a transaction through the API.
2. **Verify Email Receipt**: Check the email inbox of the customer to ensure the notification is received with the correct details.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Review application logs for any errors related to email sending or transaction processing.

### Conclusion

This update to the Email Notifications feature significantly improves customer engagement by providing timely updates on transaction statuses. The implementation ensures that customers are informed promptly, enhancing their overall experience with the Credit Card Payment System.

## Customer Creation Confirmation Email Feature

This feature sends a confirmation email to users upon successful account creation. The email includes the user's details and a plain text password.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Email Service Setup**:
    - Ensure the `spring-boot-starter-mail` dependency is included in your `pom.xml`.
    - Configure email properties in `application.properties`.

2. **Email Service Class**:
    - Create a service class to handle sending emails using `JavaMailSender`.

3. **Customer Creation Logic**:
    - Modify the customer creation logic to send a confirmation email after a new customer is created.

4. **Security Considerations**:
    - Avoid sending plain text passwords in emails. Consider sending a password reset link instead.

5. **Testing**:
    - Test the email functionality to ensure users receive confirmation emails with their details.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a brief example of how the email sending functionality is integrated:

```java
@Autowired
private EmailService emailService;

@PostMapping("/customers")
public ResponseEntity<?> createCustomer(@RequestBody Customer newCustomer) {
    // Save customer and send confirmation email
    emailService.sendConfirmationEmail(newCustomer.getEmail(), subject, body);
}
```

## Update: Credit Card Limit Management Feature

### Overview
The Credit Card Limit Management feature has been enhanced to ensure that the spending limit is correctly enforced during transactions. 

### Changes Made
- **Spending Limit Deduction**: After a successful transaction, the transaction amount is now deducted from both the credit card's balance and the spending limit. This ensures that users cannot exceed their set spending limits.

### Implementation Details
- The `spendingLimit` field in the `CreditCard` entity is now updated during the transaction processing in the `TransactionService`.
- The transaction processing logic checks if the transaction amount exceeds the spending limit before allowing the transaction to proceed.

### Testing
- Ensure to test the following scenarios:
  1. Transactions below the spending limit should succeed and deduct the amount from both the balance and the spending limit.
  2. Transactions equal to the spending limit should succeed and deduct the amount from both the balance and the spending limit.
  3. Transactions above the spending limit should fail as expected.
  4. Multiple transactions should correctly update the spending limit after each transaction.

## Monthly Spending Reports

### Feature Description

The Monthly Spending Reports feature allows users to generate a report summarizing their transactions for a specific month. The report is sent to the customer's email address and includes details such as transaction dates, amounts, descriptions, and the total spent for the month.

## Credit Card Lock/Unlock Feature

This feature allows users to temporarily lock or unlock their credit card in case of loss or theft.

### Implementation Details

- **Locking a Credit Card**: Users can lock their credit card to prevent any transactions from being processed. This is useful in situations where the card is lost or suspected to be stolen.

- **Unlocking a Credit Card**: Users can unlock their credit card when they find it or if they no longer suspect it to be compromised.

### API Endpoints

- **Lock Credit Card**
    - **Endpoint**: `PUT /credit-cards/lock/{cardId}`
    - **Description**: Locks the specified credit card.
    - **Response**: Returns the locked credit card details or a 404 status if the card is not found.

- **Unlock Credit Card**
    - **Endpoint**: `PUT /credit-cards/unlock/{cardId}`
    - **Description**: Unlocks the specified credit card.
    - **Response**: Returns the unlocked credit card details or a 404 status if the card is not found.

## Credit Card Locking and Transaction Notifications

This feature allows users to temporarily lock their credit cards and prevents any transactions from being processed when the card is locked. If a user attempts to make a transaction with a locked credit card, the system will:

1. **Check if the Credit Card is Locked**: Before processing a transaction, the system checks if the associated credit card is locked.
2. **Send Notification**: If the credit card is locked, an email notification is sent to the user indicating that their transaction attempt has failed due to the card being locked. The notification includes:
    - The transaction amount
    - Transaction ID
    - Credit Card ID
    - Transaction Date
    - Status of the transaction (FAILED)
    - A message prompting the user to unlock their card to proceed with transactions.

### Example Email Notification

When a transaction is attempted with a locked credit card, the user receives an email formatted as follows:
```
Dear Customer,

Your transaction attempt of amount [amount] [currency] has failed because your credit card is currently locked. 
Transaction ID: [transactionId] 
Credit Card ID: [creditCardId] 
Transaction Date: [transactionDate] 
Status: FAILED

Please unlock your card to proceed with transactions.

Best regards, 
Credit Card Payment System Team
```

## Card Expiration Notifications

This feature sends notifications to users when their credit cards are about to expire. The system checks for credit cards nearing their expiration date and sends an email reminder to the user.

### Implementation Details

- **Scheduled Task**: A scheduled task runs daily to check for credit cards that are set to expire within the next month.
- **Notification**: If a credit card is found to be expiring soon, an email notification is sent to the user.

### Email Notification Format

When a credit card is nearing expiration, the user receives an email formatted as follows:

```
Dear [Customer Name],

This is a reminder that your credit card ending in [Last 4 Digits of Card] is set to expire on [Expiration Date]. Please take the necessary steps to renew your card to avoid any interruptions in service.

Best regards, Credit Card Payment System Team
```

### Example

For example, if a user's credit card is set to expire on January 30, 2025, the email would look like this:
```
Dear John Doe,

This is a reminder that your credit card ending in 1234 is set to expire on 2025-01-30. Please take the necessary steps to renew your card to avoid any interruptions in service.

Best regards, Credit Card Payment System Team
```

## Features

### Card Replacement

The Card Replacement feature allows users to request a replacement for their credit card in case it is lost, stolen, or damaged.

#### How It Works

1. **Request Submission**: Users can submit a card replacement request by providing the card ID and the reason for the replacement.
2. **Processing**: The system processes the request, updates the status of the existing card, and saves the replacement request in the database.
3. **Email Notification**: Upon successful processing of the request, an email confirmation is sent to the user with the details of the new card.

#### Email Format

When a card replacement request is processed, the user receives an email with the following format:
Subject: Card Replacement Confirmation

```
Dear [Customer Name],

Your request for a card replacement has been processed successfully. New Card Details: 
Card Number: **** **** **** [Last 4 Digits] 
Card Type: [Card Type] Status: REPLACED

If you did not request this change, please contact our support team immediately.
Best regards, Credit Card Payment System Team
```

### How to Use

To request a card replacement, send a POST request to the `/card-replacements` endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "cardId": "your_card_id",
    "reason": "lost"
}
```

## Stripe Payment Integration

This project now includes integration with Stripe for handling payments. The following features have been implemented:

- **StripeService**: A service class that manages the creation of checkout sessions for products.
- **ProductRequest**: An entity that encapsulates the details of the product being purchased, including name, amount, quantity, and currency.
- **StripeResponse**: An entity that encapsulates the response from the Stripe API after creating a checkout session, including session ID and URL.
- **StripeController**: A controller that exposes an endpoint for initiating the checkout process.

### How to Use

To create a checkout session, send a POST request to `/payments/checkout` with a JSON body containing the product details:

```json
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "amount": 2000,
  "quantity": 1,
  "currency": "usd"

## Features

### Inactive Credit Card Account Management

This feature automatically closes credit card accounts that have not been used for a specified period of time. If a credit card is inactive for more than 365 days, the card issuer will close the account to maintain security and manage resources effectively.

#### How It Works

1. **Last Used Date Tracking**: Each credit card tracks the last date it was used.
2. **Scheduled Task**: A scheduled task runs daily at midnight to check all credit cards.
3. **Account Closure**: If a credit card has not been used for over a year, its status is updated to "CLOSED".

### How to Use

- The system automatically manages inactive accounts, so no user action is required.
- Users will be notified via email if their account is closed due to inactivity.

      Your payment has been successfully processed. 
      Session ID: {sessionId}

### Usage
To utilize the AI features, send a POST request to the `/ai/generate-content` endpoint with a JSON body containing your prompt.

#### Example Request
```json
{
    "prompt": "What are the benefits of using a credit card?"
}
```
```json
{
    "response": "Using a credit card can offer several benefits, including rewards points, cash back, and the ability to build credit history."
}
```
